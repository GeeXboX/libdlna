COMMON
~~~~~~

libdlna aims at being the reference open-source implementation
of DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standards.
Its primary goal is to provide DLNA support to uShare, an embedded UPnP A/V
Media Server, but will be used to build both DLNA servers and players.

libdlna relies on FFMPEG librairies (libavformat and libavcodec)
to handle and demux A/V streams.
