Description: development files for libdlna
 The reference open-source implementation of DLNA (Digital Living Network
 Alliance) standards. The primary goal is to provide DLNA support to uShare,
 an embedded UPnP A/V Media Server, but will be used to build both DLNA
 servers and players.
 .
 libdlna relies on FFMPEG librairies (libavformat and libavcodec)
 to handle and demux A/V streams.
 .
 The libdlna-dev package contains the header files, and
 debug versions of library.
